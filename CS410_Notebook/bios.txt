 Professor of Computer Science  Address:  AKW 414, 51 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511-8937 203-432-1273 dana.angluin@yale.edu Professor Angluin is interested in machine learning and computational learning theory. Algorithmic modeling and analysis of learning tasks gives insight into the phenomena of learning, and suggests avenues for the creation of tools to help people learn, and for the design of “smarter” software and artificial agents that flexibly adapt their behavior. Professor Angluin’s thesis was among the first work to apply complexity theory to the field of inductive inference. Her work on learning from positive data reversed a previous dismissal of that topic, and established a flourishing line of research. Her work on learning with queries established the models and the foundational results for learning with membership queries. Recently, her work has focused on the areas of coping with errors in the answers to queries, map-learning by mobile robots, and fundamental questions in modeling the interaction of a teacher and a learner. 
 Professor Angluin helped found the Computational Learning Theory conference, and has served on program committees for COLT and on the COLT Steering committee. She served as an area editor for Information and Computation from 1989-1992. She organized the Computer Science Department’s Perlis Symposium in April 2001: “From Statistics to Chat: Trends in Machine Learning.” She is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and the Association for Women in Mathematics.

She received a B.A. in Mathematics from Harvard and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford. Between finishing her Ph.D. in 1986 and starting at Yale in 2000, she was with AT&T, most recently in the Information Sciences Research Center of the AT&T Shannon Laboratory in Florham Park, NJ. There she established a research group in the emerging area of algorithmics for massive data sets and served as manager of the group for two years. 
 Professor Feigenbaum’s research interests include Internet algorithms, computational complexity, security and privacy, and digital copyright. She has a long-standing interest in fundamental problems in complexity theory that are motivated by cryptology and is co-inventor (with former colleagues Matt Blaze and Jack Lacy) of the security-research area of “trust management.” More recently, she has worked on basic algorithms for massive data sets, particularly those generated in network operations and business-to-consumer e-commerce. With collaborators Sampath Kannan, Martin Strauss, and Mahesh Viswanathan, Professor Feigenbaum has devised several highly influential algorithms for network-generated massive data, including a randomized algorithm for deciding whether two streams of router measurements are approximately equivalent and another for deciding whether a stream is close to having the “groupedness” property (a natural relaxation of the sortedness property). Within the area of e-commerce foundations, she has also worked on the interplay of incentives and computation. Using tools from microeconomics and game theory, computer scientists are now developing a theory of “incentive-compatible” distributed computation. In joint work with Arvind Krishnamurthy, Christos Papadimitriou, Rahul Sami, and Scott Shenker, Professor Feigenbaum has studied incentive-compatible protocols for multicast cost/sharing and interdomain routing. 
 Professor Feigenbaum has an extensive record of distinguished service to the Computer Science community. From 1997 to 2002, she served as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Cryptology. She has also been an editorial-board member for the SIAM Journal on Computing, Program Chair for the Crypto 1991 and Complexity 1998 conferences, and Program Committee member for numerous conferences and workshops. Well known for her ability to establish and explicate research priorities, Professor Feigenbaum has given many high-profile, direction-setting, invited talks, including “Security and Privacy in the Information Economy” at the 1997 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, “Games, Complexity, and Approximation Algorithms” at the 1998 International Congress of Mathematicians, and “Massive Graphs: Algorithms, Applications, and Open Problems” at the 1999 annual meetings of the American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

 A. Bartlett Giamatti Professor of Computer Science and Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science Address:  AKW 501, 51 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511-8937 203-432-1219 brian.scassellati@yale.edu Website Brian Scassellati builds human-like robots to investigate models of human development. Many scientists have used computer simulations to model complex interactions of neural function, sensory processing, and motor control. Scassellati believes that robotics offers a new kind of tool in investigating human behavior. By building robotic systems based on models of human intelligence, the full complexity of real world environments can be used in evaluating these models. This research integrates work from artificial intelligence, machine vision, classical robotics, psychology, cognitive science, and human-machine interfaces. 
 One of the major focuses of Scassellati’s work has been on how children develop social skills and an understanding of other people. Children gradually acquire many skills that allow them to learn from their interactions with adults, such as responding to pointing gestures, recognizing what someone else is looking at, and representing that other people have beliefs, goals, and desires that differ from those of the child. These abilities have often been called a “theory of mind” and are believed to be critical for language acquisition, for self-recognition, and in the development of imaginative play. Computational models of these skills are being developed, implemented, and tested on robotic platforms currently under construction. His previous robots have performed tasks such as imitating human arm gestures, distinguishing animate from inanimate stimuli based on self-propelled motion criteria, and learning to reach for visual targets. 
 By building machines with social skills, we can not only begin to model human development but also construct machines with more natural interfaces. Machines that can engage in the same social dynamics that people use with each other will be easier to use, will be usable in a wider range of situations, and will not require the user to learn arbitrary commands. 
 One of Scassellati’s current projects is to develop robotic systems that aid in the diagnosis of autism by autonomously classifying social interactions. He is also currently building a new robotic system that will help teach social skills to autistic children. Additional projects focus on how children build a representation of objects as entities that exist through space and time, how animate stimuli are distinguished from inanimate objects, how sensation and motor control coordination are achieved in simple arm movements, and how children and animals distinguish themselves from others.

 Thomas L. Kempner Professor of Computer Science; Department Chair of Computer Science Department Address:  AKW 314, 51 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511-8937 203-432-6828 zhong.shao@yale.edu Website Zhong Shao is a Professor of Computer Science at Yale University. His research interests include programming languages, compilers, formal methods, and operating systems. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University in 1994. During his early career, he was a key developer and author of many key compilation phases used in the Standard ML of New Jersey compiler, and also one of the first to build a type-based intermediate representation in a functional-language compiler. He designed and developed the first production-quality type-preserving compiler for the entire Standard ML 1997 language extended with higher-order modules and was the main architect of the FLINT certifying infrastructure. 
 In recent years, he has been interested in developing and applying new language-based technologies to build certified system software (e.g., OS kernels and hypervisors). Certified software consists of a binary machine executable plus a rigorous machine-checkable proof that the software is free of bugs with respect to specific requirements. A certified OS kernel is a library-based kernel but with formal specifications and proofs about all of its abstraction layers and system libraries. Dr. Shao’s current research intends to attack the following three important questions: (1) Under a clean-slate approach, what are the right OS kernel structures that can offer the best support for resilience, extensibility, and security? (2) What are the best programming languages and developing environments for implementing such certified kernels? (3) What new formal methods we need to develop in order to support these new languages and make certified kernels both practical and scalable?

His latter research focuses are on end-to-end network congestion control and secure multicast. For congestion control, his research has spanned the life cycle of congestion control: design of new congestion control scheme, characterization of congestion control protocols, evaluation of the impacts of congestion control on emerging multimedia applications, and extension of unicast congestion control to multicast congestion control. For secure multicast, he is one of the main developers of keygem, a multicast group key management system that implements scalable and reliable rekeying. 
 Yang is currently interested in the problems of network congestion control and group key management in the context of wireless and mobile networks as well as a network under denial of service attack. Given his past experience, he also follows closely the researches in artificial intelligence and database.
